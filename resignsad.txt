Dear Ka Yudo,

I hope this letter finds you well. It is with a mixture of gratitude and regret that I submit my resignation from my position as Front-End Intern at AdainAcara, effective next week.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at AdainAcara and appreciate the opportunities I have been given to contribute to the team. The experiences and skills I have gained during my tenure have been invaluable, and I am grateful for the support and guidance provided by you and the entire team.

However, after discussions with my family and reflection on my current priorities, I have come to the realization that I need to redirect my focus towards my college education. As I am currently pursuing my studies, the demands of my coursework have increased, and I believe it is in my best interest to dedicate more time and energy to excel in my academic endeavors.

I want to express my sincere gratitude for the mentorship and professional growth I have experienced during my time at AdainAcara. I have learned a great deal, and I am confident that the skills and knowledge gained here will contribute significantly to my future endeavors.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition during the two-week notice period and will make every effort to complete any outstanding tasks or assist in the transition of my responsibilities. I am open to discussing the transition process and training a replacement if necessary.

I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. I look forward to maintaining positive connections with the team and hope our paths may cross again in the future.

Thank you once again for the opportunity to be a part of the AdainAcara family.


Sincerely,

Zidan
