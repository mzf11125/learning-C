Jojo is playing with ice cubes. He puts some ice cube sized 2
×
2
× 2 on a table. He
wanted to make
N stacks adjecent to each other stacks with
Xi cubes for the
i
th stack.
Jojo is curious how much is the perimeter and area of the stacks given Jojo is looking at
the stacks from the front in 2-dimentional form. Help Jojo calculate the perimeter and
the area
Format Input
The input will consist of several lines of input in ”testdata.in” file. First consists of
T
,
the number of test cases. For each testcase consists of integer
N, the number of stacks.
The next line consists of the
N integer, the number
Xi
for the
i
th stack.
Format Output
Output should be expressed in format ”Case #X:
Y1
Y2” - X is the number of the test
case, and followed by
Y1 and
Y2 - The perimeter and the area of the test case.
Constraints • 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 • 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 • 1 ≤ Xi ≤ 100
