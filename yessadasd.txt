Bibi is celebrating her 21st birthday party. She invites you and another 5 friends to join
the party. Lucky to you and her friends, you will get a private room to enjoy the party
with Bibi.
Bibi decided to play with her 5 friends (except you) because Bibi wants your help. Her
friends (those five friends) will think of a random number (
Mi). Then, Bibi will give
them some pieces of blank paper.
Firstly, the
i
th person should add his/her chosen number
Mi with
Mi
itself and then write
the result on the blank paper. Then, they should put the paper they wrote before to
Bibi’s bag. Then, Bibi ask them to shake each other’s hands. If
i
th person shake hands
with
j
th person, then both of
i
th and
j
th person should write
Mi
+
Mj
in their paper and
put the paper into the bag. This procedure stops when everyone already shakes each
other’s hands.
After that, Bibi should guess the possible 5 numbers that her friends just think about.You
should help Bibi to determine those 5 numbers. It is guaranteed that the solution exists
and unique.
Format Input
Input consists of one integer
T, number of test case given by Bibi. For each test case,
there is a line with 25 integers
S, the addition result written by her 5 friends (sum of
Mi
and
Mj
for every possible
i and
j).
Format Output
Output should be expressed in format “Case #
X: Y1
Y2
Y3
Y4
Y5” -
X is the number of the
test case (starting from 1), and followed by 5 integer
Y , the 5 numbers in non-decreasing
sequence.

Explanation
On Sample Input 1 (test case 1), the first 5 numbers on the sequence is the result after
summation of 1 with 1,2,3,4, and 5. For the next 5 numbers, it is also the result after
summation of 2 with 1,2,3,4, and 5. And so on until number 5. So we can conclude that
1,2,3,4,5 is the expected 5 numbers written by Bibi’s friends.
