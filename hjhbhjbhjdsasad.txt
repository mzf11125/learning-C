Bibi is a lecturer at a university. At the end of the exam, Bibi’s students always come
to her and ask about their ranking in the exam. Because Bibi is a good lecturer, Bibi
always gives answers to them by looking at the grades book one by one.
However, Bibi also felt that there was a faster way than having to check each student’s
name one by one in the grades book. She also asked for your help to create a program
that seeks a student ranking from the student data.
If there are students who have the same value, then the ranking will be determined based
on lexicographic order. So, if there are 2 students named AAA and BBB with a value of
80. Then the AAA rating will be above BBB.
Format Input
The first line input contains
T, the number of testcases. For each testcase consists of
several lines. For the first row, it consists of
N, which is the number of students taught
by Bibi. For the next
N line consists of “NAME#VALUE” of each student. On the
N + 1 row consists of 1 name, the name of the student who asked about his ranking.
Format Output
For each test case, generate “Case
#
X: Y ”, where
X represents the test case number
and
Y shows the rank of the student.
Constraints • 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 • 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 • 1 ≤ |NAMA| ≤ 10 • 1 ≤ N ilai ≤ 1000
